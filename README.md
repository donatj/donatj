### Hello!

I am a PHP, Go and TypeScript developer based in Minneapolis. 

I work across the entire stack, but I’m happiest in the backend. Moving data, pushing bytes around, making things fast.

I ❤️ tiny reusable parts with single responsibilities and no side effects. I keep code simple, clear, and easy for anyone to read.

I’ve spent fifteen years in EdTech keeping old systems running and new ones from catching fire. Before that I built industrial and B2B tools where things had to work because people depended on them.
