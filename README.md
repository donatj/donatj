### Hello!

I am a PHP and Go developer based in Minneapolis. Full stack capable, I generally prefer backend and data work as I find it less prickly.

I ❤️ tiny reusable modules with single responsibilities.

I have spent the last decade working in K-12 educational software. Before that I spent five years building industrial and b2b software.
